# Team Nexus Website

## Introduction

> Team Nexus is a group of Annihilation, MineZ, and HCF players! The goal of this site is to advertise the group's Discord server by enticing viewers about the benefits of joining the group as well as giving users general information.

## The Code

> The site is meant to be an exercise for Athys (Athysss on GitHub) to test his knowledge on web design and developement. The site will be built using SASS for styling (it will be compiled to CSS) and HTML. The site will be mostly static with a few JavaScript animations.

## What's To Come

> In the future, the site will utilize the Discord API to create both a thorough list of members and their ranks as well as the developement and deployment of a Discord bot built for the server.
